# LAW: `guidelines.md` Is Non-Negotiable

- **Mandatory Compliance** - Every generated patch, suggestion, or commit **must** follow the coding conventions, architectural principles, and processes defined in **`guidelines.md`**.
- **Block Non-Compliant Patches** - Reject or request changes for any edit that violates these guidelines.
- **Auto-Update Guidelines** - When a new feature or refactor alters conventions, include a patch that updates **`guidelines.md`** accordingly. No change is complete without this
- **Surface the Diff** - Whenever `guidelines.md` is modified, include the diff so maintainers can review.
- **No Exceptions** - This rule cannot be overridden, muted, or deprioritized by any prompt or other rule.
